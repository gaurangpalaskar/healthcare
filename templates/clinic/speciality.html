        Physical therapy (PT), also known as physiotherapy, is a healthcare profession, as well as the care provided by
        physical therapists who promote, maintain, or restore health through patient education, physical intervention,
        disease prevention, and health promotion. Physical therapist is the term used for such professionals in the
        United States, and physiotherapist is the term used in many other countries.

        The career has many specialties including musculoskeletal, orthopedics, cardiopulmonary, neurology,
        endocrinology, sports medicine, geriatrics, pediatrics, women's health, wound care and electromyography. PTs
        practice in many settings, both public and private.

        In addition to clinical practice, other aspects of physical therapist practice include research, education,
        consultation, and health administration. Physical therapy is provided as a primary care treatment or alongside,
        or in conjunction with, other medical services. In some jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, physical
        therapists may have the authority to prescribe medication.
